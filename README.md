Dataset: Household Power Consumption

Description:
The dataset "Household Power Consumption" contains measurements of electric power consumption in a household over a period of time. It includes various features such as global active power, global reactive power, voltage, and energy submetering for different appliances. The data is recorded at a per-minute frequency and covers multiple days.

Plots:

Plot 1: Global Active Power by Day

This plot shows the average global active power consumption for each day of the week. It helps in understanding the variation in power usage throughout the week.
Plot 2: Voltage by Day

This plot displays the average voltage level for each day of the week. It provides insights into the stability of voltage over different days.
Plot 3: Energy Submetering by Day

This plot illustrates the average energy consumption for three different submetering categories (Submetering 1, Submetering 2, Submetering 3) over each day of the week. It helps in analyzing the distribution of energy usage among different appliances or areas of the household.
Plot 4: Global Reactive Power by Day

This plot depicts the average global reactive power consumption for each day of the week. It allows for understanding the patterns of reactive power usage over different days.
